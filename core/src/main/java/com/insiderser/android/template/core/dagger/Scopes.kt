/**
 * By default, if no scope annotation is present, the injector creates an instance, uses the
 * instance for one injection, and then forgets it. If a scope annotation is present, the
 * injector may retain the instance for possible reuse in a later injection.
 *
 * Scopes TL;DR:
 *  - No scope = new instance created every time
 *  - `@Singleton` = only one instance
 *  - `@CustomScope` = instance reused depending on the componentâ€™s lifecycle
 *
 * In Dagger, an unscoped component cannot depend on a scoped component. As
 * CoreComponent is a scoped component (`@Singleton`, we create a custom
 * scope to be used by all fragment components. Additionally, a component with a specific scope
 * cannot have a sub component with the same scope.
 *
 * The [ActivityScope] scoping annotation specifies that the lifespan of a dependency be the same
 * as that of an [activity][android.app.Activity]. This is used to annotate dependencies that behave
 * like a singleton within the lifespan of an [android.app.Activity].
 *
 * `@Singleton` is used to specify that the lifespan
 * of a dependency be the same as that of the [android.app.Application].

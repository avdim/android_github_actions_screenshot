[![Codacy badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/041b5a6aaea24bb58766ac38b02263b5)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/Insiderser/AndroidTemplate?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Insiderser/AndroidTemplate&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is the project that contains all the common
logic that I use (or plan to use) to build Android apps.

This template includes:

- boilerplate code that we do in most Android apps nowadays
- multi-module setup
- CI configuration with GitHub Actions
- Dagger setup
- settings
